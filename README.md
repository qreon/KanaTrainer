KanaTrainer  
======================================
&nbsp;  
A little utility developped in C++.  
I am currently learning Japanese and I lacked something to practice writing hiragana and katakana, so I did this.  
It allows you to choose between series of ideograms, that will be randomly displayed on the screen, written in romaji, so you can practice writing them in kana.

This was made in a few hours on one evening so I did not bother with a real design work to do this. As a result, the source code is functionnal, but **dirty as hell**. Classes do **a lot** more than they should, dependencies across the classes are **super-strong**, stuff like that.  
I seriously hope none of my professors get their eyes on such code because I would be expelled from my school.
